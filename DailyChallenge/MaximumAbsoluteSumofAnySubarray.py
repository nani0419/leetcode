# You are given an integer array nums. The absolute sum of a subarray [numsl, numsl+1, ..., numsr-1, numsr] is abs(numsl + numsl+1 + ... + numsr-1 + numsr).

# Return the maximum absolute sum of any (possibly empty) subarray of nums.

# Note that abs(x) is defined as follows:

# If x is a negative integer, then abs(x) = -x.
# If x is a non-negative integer, then abs(x) = x.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,-3,2,3,-4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The subarray [2,3] has absolute sum = abs(2+3) = abs(5) = 5.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,-5,1,-4,3,-2]
# Output: 8
# Explanation: The subarray [-5,1,-4] has absolute sum = abs(-5+1-4) = abs(-8) = 8


# Hints:
# 1. What if we asked for maximum sum, not absolute sum?
# 2. It's a standard problem that can be solved by Kadane's algorithm.
# 3. The key idea is the max absolute sum will be either the max sum or the min sum.
# 4. So just run kadane twice, once calculating the max sum and once calculating the min sum.

# Explanation:
# Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient way to solve the maximum subarray sum problem. The problem is to find the contiguous subarray (within a given one-dimensional numeric array) which has the largest sum.

# Problem Definition:
# Given an integer array nums, you need to find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) that has the largest sum and return its sum.

# Kadane's Algorithm Explanation:
# Kadaneâ€™s algorithm works by iterating through the array and maintaining two variables:

# current_sum: Tracks the sum of the current subarray as we iterate through the array.
# max_sum: Tracks the maximum sum encountered so far.
# The idea is:

# For each element in the array, decide whether to:
# Add the element to the current subarray (current_sum), or
# Start a new subarray from this element.
# You choose the larger of these two options:

# If adding the current element to the subarray leads to a larger sum, keep adding.
# If starting a new subarray leads to a larger sum, reset the current sum to the current element.
# Algorithm Steps:
# Initialize:
# current_sum = 0
# max_sum = -infinity (or a very small number initially)
# Traverse the array, and for each element:
# Update current_sum: Take the maximum between the current element and the sum of current_sum + element.
# Update max_sum: Track the maximum of max_sum and current_sum.
# Return max_sum as the result.
# Time Complexity:
# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The algorithm makes just one pass through the array.
# Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses only a constant amount of space.




# Example Walkthrough:
# For nums = [2, -5, 1, -4, 3, -2], hereâ€™s how the code works:

# Calculate the prefix sum s: Using accumulate(nums, initial=0), we get:

# ini
# Copy
# s = [0, 2, -3, -2, -6, -3, -5]
# The initial=0 is added at the beginning, so s[0] = 0.
# Each subsequent value in s is the cumulative sum up to that index in the original nums array.
# Find the maximum and minimum values in s:

# max(s) = 2
# min(s) = -6
# Compute the result: The maximum absolute sum is max(s) - min(s) = 2 - (-6) = 8.

# Final Output:
# For the input [2, -5, 1, -4, 3, -2], the output is 8.
